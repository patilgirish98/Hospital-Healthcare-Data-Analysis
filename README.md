# Hospital-Healthcare-Data-Analysis
This Power BI dashboard provides an interactive and visual overview of key operational and financial metrics for Patil Hospital. It tracks admission/discharge dates, follow-up schedules, billing vs health insurance amounts, and diagnosis types (like viral infections, flu, malaria, etc.).

The dashboard helps hospital management monitor patient flow, optimize bed usage, evaluate treatment trends, and assess financial performanceâ€”all in one view. Built using Power BI with custom visuals and DAX, this project supports better healthcare decision-making through data-driven insights.
